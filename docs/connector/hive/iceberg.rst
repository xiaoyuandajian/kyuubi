`Iceberg`_
==========

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets.
Iceberg adds tables to compute engines including Spark, Trino, PrestoDB, Flink, Hive and Impala
using a high-performance table format that works just like a SQL table.

.. tip::
   This article assumes that you have mastered the basic knowledge and operation of `Iceberg`_.
   For the knowledge about Iceberg not mentioned in this article,
   you can obtain it from its `Official Documentation`_.

By using kyuubi, we can run SQL queries towards Iceberg which is more
convenient, easy to understand, and easy to expand than directly using
hive to manipulate Iceberg.

Iceberg Integration
-------------------

To enable the integration of kyuubi hive sql engine and Iceberg, you need to:

- Referencing the Iceberg :ref:`dependencies<hive-iceberg-deps>`
- Setting the hive extension and catalog :ref:`configurations<hive-iceberg-conf>`

.. _hive-iceberg-deps:

Dependencies
************

The **classpath** of kyuubi hive sql engine with Iceberg supported consists of

1. kyuubi-hive-sql-engine-\ |release|\ _2.12.jar, the engine jar deployed with a Kyuubi distribution
2. a copy of hive distribution
3. iceberg-hive-runtime-<hive.version>_<scala.version>-<iceberg.version>.jar (example: iceberg-hive-runtime-3.2_2.12-0.14.0.jar), which can be found in the `Maven Central`_

In order to make the Iceberg packages visible for the runtime classpath of engines, we can use the method:

1. Execute ADD JAR statement in the Kyuubi to add dependencies to Hiveâ€™s auxiliary classpath. For example:

.. code-block:: sql

   ADD JAR /path/to/iceberg-hive-runtime.jar;

.. warning::
   Please mind the compatibility of different Iceberg and Hive versions, which can be confirmed on the page of `Iceberg multi engine support`_.

.. _hive-iceberg-conf:

Configurations
**************

To activate functionality of Iceberg, we can set the following configurations:
Set ``iceberg.engine.hive.enabled=true`` in the Hadoop configuration. For example, setting this in the hive-site.xml

Iceberg Operations
------------------

Taking ``CREATE TABLE`` as a example,

.. code-block:: sql

   CREATE TABLE x (i int) STORED BY 'org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler';
   CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE x (i int) STORED BY 'org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler';

Taking ``SELECT`` as a example,

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM foo;

Taking ``INSERT`` as a example,

.. code-block:: sql

   INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c');
   INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE target SELECT * FROM source;

Taking ``ALTER`` as a example,

.. code-block:: sql

   ALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES('...'='...');
